Contains Jupyter Notebooks with Markdown and code (Python 3.7) covering content from the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) (DC) Ecology curriculum, [Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/) lesson. The data used in these notebooks are available from the Ecology Curriculum webpage.

These notebooks cover the following topics:

1. Indexing, slicing and subsetting `pandas` dataframes (DC Episode: [Indexing, Slicing and Subsetting DataFrames in Python](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/03-index-slice-subset/index.html ))
2. Combining `pandas` dataframes (DC Episode: [Combining DataFrames with Pandas](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/05-merging-data/index.html))
3. Data workfows and automation (DC Episode: [Data Workflows and Automation](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/06-loops-and-functions/index.html))
4. Plotting data with `matplotlib` (DC Episode: [Data Ingest and Visualization - Matplotlib and Pandas](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/08-putting-it-all-together/index.html))

These notebooks additionally draw on content from the following Carpentries lessons in order to describe concepts:

- Data Carpentry, Social Science Curriculum, [Data Analysis and Visualization with Python for Social Scientists *alpha*](https://datacarpentry.org/python-socialsci/)
- Software Carpentry, [Plotting and Programming in Python](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/)
